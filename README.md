# food-history-api
A REST API that will be used to service an upcoming recipe catalog/food diary application

NOTE: In order to run this locally, you will need a file named `connectionsettings.json` in the root directory. This should contain several properties to connect to a database with a schema set up by the provided SQL queries in `/SQLTableDefinitions`.

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `datasource` | The URL of the data source |
| `database` | The name of the database containing the schema |
| `username` | The username to access the database |
| `password` | The password to access the database |

Eventually, a database with this setup may be publically avaliable, but I don't currently have the resources to host it.
